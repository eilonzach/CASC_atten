% script to test the effects of removing tilt and compliance

% compare arrivals for three earthquakes (best, medium, ratty)
% at three different stations (or 5?) from ridge to thick seds to land
% (two) - try to pick these stations along a section

% compute relative attenuation and travel time (using whatever method) on
% un-corrected data

% correct data for tilt and compliance (use Helen's compliance functions?
% or compute my own from the 2-day windows)

% look at admittance spectrum - is this likely to mess with my attenuation
% spectrum?

% actually calculate the new relative TT and attenuation.
